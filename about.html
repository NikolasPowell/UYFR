                <p class="lead">Hello everyone! My name is Elle and Im a furniture restoration enthusiest. My involvement in this business started a couple years before covid, as I wanted to expand my expertiest and knowledge on the creative side. I love doing this and every piece of furniture that I work on I treat it as if it was going to be one of my own. Currently, I have two boys, one who attends MSU and is graduating and one who attends our local high school and will be graduating soon as well. We also have to cats, Bailey and Sasha who always enjoy bathing in the sun and taking long naps! When i'm not working on furniture, i'm always researching more information and techniques on how to make furniture look absoluelty stunning. When summer and fall come around, I love to take camping trips and get out of town once and a while, a dream spot to camp is in Jimmy Buffett Margaritaville Auburndale in Florida! I hope to meet all of you if you stop by for some furniture! Take Care!</p>
